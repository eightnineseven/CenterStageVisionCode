// Scan the 3 regions for color cube: Color code finished, just need to determine the color we're looking for
// Drop first pixel on correct tape: Lift movement + encoder movement - Encoder movement basis created, lift is an unknown
// Move to board: Drive to april tag dependent on original color code - repurpose the example code
// drop pixel: lift arm to needed height and release - lift movement is unknown
// retract lift: lift movement - lift movement is unknown
// park: encoder movement - encoder movement basis created
//total points possible: 45
// issues: dropping pixel on board may not be feasible for first comp, rest should be possible brings total points to 25 in auto
